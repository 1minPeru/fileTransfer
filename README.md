# fileTransfer


Created this project because my dad needed to transfer all .jar files that met the following criteria to a destination folder
Criteria:
- is a .jar file
- is in a subdirectory 1 level below the source directory

The .jar files that met this criteria were moved to the specified destination folder and duplicates were replaced

#How to use:
Input Source and Destination directories
Watch magic happen :)

This is obviously for a specific case, the code can easily be altered to take all subdirectories or certain types of files etc.
